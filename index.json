[{"categories":["Project Release","Game Development"],"content":" Itch.io Link For the past 5 days I have done what I have failed to do many times before, complete the process of making a game. The game was for the NUCATS Game Jam. NUCATS is the Newcastle University Computing and Technology Society. It was made in Unity (with great help from Brackeys), and it was really the first reasonably sized game I’ve made. The only other thing I’ve ever made in Unity was Ping which, as the name suggests, was a pong clone. Type or Die is a top-down zombie shooter where it is not about how good your aim is, but how fast you can type. Waves of zombies come at you in all directions, with the direction they come from determining what key to press to shoot at them (e.g a zombie coming from the top right would be shot at using the ‘p’ key). The game jam has come in a time between some pretty busy weeks so I have surprised myself by actually getting a finished game out. I even contemplated not taking part at all after the first day because I felt I just wouldn’t be able to do it. I started off (as optimistic idiots often do) full of goals with zero plans. Every step of the way I was decreasing scope to match my skill and enthusiasm, and its where those paths crossed that the game was made. I knew that the most complex thing I could make in the time with limited skill was a 2d, single-screen game. Guns are an easy way to make the mundane exciting, so the game became a shooter, and wanting to have the computer do all the work for you meant that it became a wave shooter for replayability. Every waking moment from Monday to Thursday was spent either watching Suits or making this game, and the sheer intensity of such an endeavour in the middle of some pretty hectic University team projects made me realise one thing, I will probably not make another game for a very long time. If you have a gander at my projects page you will see that all of them are game, so you may think that I really enjoy game-making. But in retrospect I think I only made games as an outlet for programming rather than an outlet for artistic ideas. Creation is a painful process, so you have to see the purpose in it. As much as I am proud of what I achieved with each of the games I made, I can’t see them as providing a service. My perspective on games has completely changed in the past year, I place a huge value on the incredible narrative experiences offered by the likes of ‘God of War’ or ‘The Beginners Guide’, these are games made by people with something to say and the skill to say it. There is certainly a place for arcade shooters, but if I don’t feel passionate about the things I create then I will never see them as worth the time I put into them. Type or Die marks the end of the 4-year-long adventure that started this whole blog off, I suppose it is fitting that it should end with another top down arcade shooter. The game is pretty fun, the zombie death animations are my favourite part (also an original theme made by my musically inept hand). More projects lie on the horizon, and the times they are a changin'.

This is merely a detailing of why I have chosen to switch Operating System I have, over the course of the past year, consumed pretty much every interpretation and adaptation of Sherlock Holmes out there, from the original works to tangentially linked shows such as the excellent House MD; one thing I have come to understand is that you can only deduce correctly if your initial assumptions are correct. Logic is useless if its underlying axioms are unstable. So we turn to my current assumption when I use computers “Everything must be done in Windows”. I have used Windows all my life, all the software I need is on Windows, and all other operating systems are either anaemic in their UX and feature set or are incapable of running on my hardware. It just stands to reason, or does it? Lets look at that first point, ‘I have used Windows all my life’. That is not a very good reason, and the weakest of all. It is indeed true but it shouldn’t have any bearing on choice of Operating System, it is an unquestioned ideology rather than any valid argument. The second axiom, ‘all the software I need is on windows’, was probably true for quite a long time. For instance, if I wanted to play any windows games I would have been bang out of luck in days gone by, but tools such as Lutris and the strides made in WINE have made that side of things perfectly capable for my needs. Needless to say Mac is straying further away at this point with their move to ARM so the assumption still holds true for them. Outside of gaming, all the apps I need are actually available on Linux. My academic work in Computer Science lends itself perfectly to Linux. All the IDEs I use (the JetBrains suite) are available and the terminal is actually more conducive to my studies compared to the limited Unix-like aliases in the Windows Powershell. The only notable exception on Linux is the lack of the Microsoft Office Suite, but I was quite staggered when I realised that I don’t actually have any need for it. My long form writing is now done in LaTeX (see my reasons for that here), and I don’t use Excel or PowerPoint. Should the need ever arise, there is the native LibreOffice suite, and the cross platform Google Docs. And if compatibility is a necessity then Microsoft also now offers a web app version of the suite. The second point links to the third, that other operating systems have terrible UX. The king of UX is obviously MacOS, but that obviously doesn’t support my hardware or the ability to run the occasional windows game. I had always perceived Linux as having terrible UX because I always just viewed through the lens of someone who has used Windows their whole life. I always just assumed (once again question your assumptions) that how a Linux distro shipped was how it was. I thought I would have to be stuck with the bland, Ubuntu default GNOME desktop and icons with their washed out colours and pre-iOS 6 style realism. I was completely wrong about this and now we are going to look at where Linux, my new Operating System, is actually better for my needs. The Linux way of thinking Linux is about what Computers were built to do, and it is about the things that us Computer people love. GNU/Linux is a whole software ecosystem that is far greater than what Windows could ever hope for and only rivaled by what Apple has cultivated on its platforms. Unlike Apple, however, GNU/Linux also offers the user complete freedom in every aspect, and there are levels to this. Yes there are demigods that are compiling their own kernels but because there is such a community driven approach, other people have performed every possible layer of abstraction. Over the decades other people have been putting rungs at all levels of the ladder for other people to step on. Because Linux is built for the community by the community, it doesn’t fight me.

I chose Manjaro, at first by design and then retroactively I realised that I would have had to go with something like it anyway. I wanted a distribution that didn’t come with the usual GNOME look, something that either looked excellent at first glance or had extensive customisation capabilities, and something that was pretty light on what it came with. I ended up narrowing it down to Manjaro and Elementary OS. In the end I chose Manjaro between the two because Elementary seemed slightly far behind in its update cycle compared to the Ubuntu it is based off and its never fun to start off with something knowing there is a major version incredibly close. It turned out in the end that Manjaro was really my best choice between the two anyway thanks to its easy switching between Kernels.

We’re about to get meta as we discuss how this site you’re exploring right now came to be. Why have a website? I want something to point to when someone asks ‘so what have you done?’. I also need it for when I ask myself the same thing. Sometimes I wonder how much I have actually done in my spare time, and a site like this helps me to remember that I haven’t wasted all of my spare time on Minecraft. Why make your own website? Here in Computer Science land: men are real men, women are real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri are real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri; thanks to these huge revelations in the field of existentialism we take it upon ourselves to walk the road already taken. The real reason is I ought to have side-projects, more than I used to. I have more time, not just because of COVID but also because Computer Science is now the only academic subject I have to pay attention to, whereas most of my time in Sixth Form was spent on Maths and Further Maths. It made reasonable sense for the first project to be a platform for my other projects and this is that platform. Where did you start? I knew I wanted to make a website with a Flask back end for 2 reasons: I wanted a back-end that could enable things like logging in and writing blog posts all within the site. I vehemently hate JavaScript and would prefer to do as much with python as possible. In fact this whole site doesn’t have any JavaScript. You can inspect element and see that everything front end is done through CSS and HTML; this is certain to change but I will hold out for as long as I can. For the uninitiated, websites have 2 parts: A front end and a back end. In a simple form, the front end is everything you see (HTML, CSS, JS) and the backend is everything you don’t (Databases, Form requests, etc). Flask is a python framework that allows the said language to be used to serve all your requests. I had used Flask in the past whilst following the Harvard CS50x course back in 2019 to make a fake stocks app (💎👐). This time round, to re-familiarise myself I followed this excellent tutorial. After you are let loose on your own (especially in web dev) I found you have to have goals and a purpose to what you are doing otherwise it’ll never happened. I persevered through the trial-and-error process that is CSS I used a couple of sites for reference when I was making the design for the sight. These were the sights of: my new friend George Wood, the blog of Casey Liss, the blog of Marco Arment, and Hypercritical (No prizes for guessing which podcast I listen to). What extra things have you done? I’m honoured at your presumption that I go above and beyond in the call of duty. The main thing I have done is make all my posts in markdown. Yes, all my posts are entirely written in markdown which makes me able to write nicely structured documents quickly. The raw text of the markdown is stored as a regular text field in the sqlite database but at the stage when the backend grabs the field from the database, jinja parses it as html using the python module mistune. To spice the formatting up even further, since I will be probably be using code snippets, I added the syntax highlighter pygments. In fact here is the code for the highlight renderer being rendered in it: import mistune from pygments import highlight from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name from pygments.formatters import html class HighlightRenderer(mistune.Renderer): def block_code(self, code, lang=None): if lang: lexer = get_lexer_by_name(lang, stripall=True) formatter = html.HtmlFormatter(style='monokai', noclasses=True) return highlight(code, lexer, formatter) return '\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e' + mistune.escape(code) + '\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e' It goes without saying that this website will continue to be updated as I change my mind on a few things and wish to add more functionality.

There was a time when we were young, stupid and thought that the peak of document formatting was WordArt, a drop shadow, and rainbow II. We would stick borders on our .pub files and feel superior if our PowerPoints had a dissolve transition. As we age past primary school we begin to conform to the world’s sensibilities that Comic Sans is not an adequate typeface and having every colour on the spectrum is a way to actually guarantee some of your text will be unreadable. Since we are forced to conform, we might as well do it to perfection, and you can only go so far in a tool that still thinks that word processors need a background ‘water droplet’ texture fill. What is this LaTeX and Why is it Not Pronounced Like That? If you want a tool that focuses on the nicest looking documents without caving into the design requirements of 7 year olds, you have to go back to a time before texture fills. Actually you have to go back to a time before computers could even show pictures. Nice looking documents (i.e had legible fonts) had to be obtained using specialised typesetters that cost as much as a house, either that or you’d use a literal printing press – this was the time in which TeX was created. LaTeX is built on TeX and is its more approachable step-son. LaTeX uses a mark-up language to design its document with the idea being that you focus on the content while the engine works out the best formatting. Isn’t This a Bit of a Faff? It depends on your personality. If you are happy with documents that are only adequate, then continue in your mediocrity. But for those of us who seek perfection and see neuroplasticity as a fundamental attribute, LaTeX offers a sterling reward for your efforts. How Good Does it Look? In the days when people weren’t made of pixels I spent the time making my own word template. It had wonderful serif headings; all the styles used Word’s tools so it did as much of the heavy lifting as possible; and all the font sizes were made just right. The results from Word are as follows: It looks okay. It looks far better than what some people create in Word. Even creating something okay looking feels like a hack though. Having nice paragraph spacing underneath headings required my to individually change all the line spacing options by hand. Anyone who has ever tried to implement code into a word document also knows that it will require you to sacrifice your firstborn. Now, for a LaTeX document: No time spent messing with templates, no changing font sizes, and it probably took me less time to make a document that looks even better. The best thing about LaTeX is that because everything is done programmatically, it can have an integration that is mind boggling. For instance, if you want to insert a segment of a python script in your document you dont actually need to copy and paste bits into your .tex file. You can just tell it where the script is, give it the line numbers and it will display and format it all for you. Where Do I Begin? This is for those of a Windows disposition First install a distribution of LaTeX called MiKTeX. MiKTeX has everything you need and will make the whole experience as easy as possible. Our code editor is called TeXworks, so open that up and lets write some LaTeX. LaTeX follows a syntax of \\command[option]{parameter} and we start a document off by selecting the type of document we want to create, and then starting and ending said document. There are a number of document classes but article is the one recommended for most documents. % Start of Document (Comments are denoted by a percentage at the start of the line) \\documentclass{article} \\begin{document} I'm so pretty \\end{document} And we get: Currently it looks like a note left by a serial killer with access to a typewriter so lets stick our name on it.

So we had to make a game in something that was the furthest you could get from a game engine with a language I had never used before. But hey, Rogue was made in 1980 and the graphics had to be ASCII so it could be worse. The rest of the class generally stuck to the brief with 3 dice that you rolled and you got points for each dot. As you can see, its rather simple. Theres 4 picture boxes, 4 labels, 2 buttons and a listbox. Dice are rolled, the dots are added up and the score is added to the listbox. After 5 rolls the game ends and the player is given their total score. But to know how I added further features we need to look at how this prototype was made. Behind the prototype Dim Die1, Die2, Die3 As Integer Dim DicePoints As Integer Dim random As Random Dim RollCount As Integer = 0 So we have our variables declared in the convoluted VB way. Die1, Die2, and Die3 and the scores for the corresponding dice. DicePoints is the total of those 3 scores and rollcount keeps track of how many times the dice were rolled. Random is just an object we use to generate random numbers Private Sub tmrTimer_Tick(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles tmrTimer.Tick 'Increments the load bar every tick random = New Random prbLoad.Increment(4) If prbLoad.Value = 100 Then ... Else 'Sets dice to random number when the timer ticks before the load is full Die1 = random.Next(1, 7) Die2 = random.Next(1, 7) Die3 = random.Next(1, 7) MatchImage(Die1, pbxDie1) MatchImage(Die2, pbxDie2) MatchImage(Die3, pbxDie3) End If On the board is a timer (inventfully called tmrTimer), it tick every 0.1s. Each tick it adds a bit onto the load bar at the bottom and randomizes the images on the dice. MatchImage is my own subroutine but all it does is take an integer and applies the correct face for it to whichever picture box I pass it. Once the bar gets to 100, the fun begins. If prbLoad.Value = 100 Then 'Adds the necessary points on the random dice when the load bar 'reaches 100 tmrTimer.Stop() prbLoad.Value = 0 RollCount += 1 DicePoints = Die1 + Die2 + Die3 We stop the timer ticking, we empty the load bar and we increment our roll counter before adding up all the spots on the dice, pretty simple. 'Adds Score to list lstScore.Items.Add(\"Roll \" \u0026 RollCount \u0026 \": \" \u0026 DicePoints) GameScore += DicePoints DicePoints = 0 Almost done, we add our points to the listbox with some formatting. Add the points to the total score for the game and then set it back to 0. If RollCount \u003e= 5 Then MsgBox(\"Your game score was \" \u0026 GameScore,, \"Game Over\") tmrTimer.Stop() btnStart.Enabled = False btnReset.Enabled = True End If Then we check whether they have reached the magic 5 rolls, if so we tell them their score and let them reset the game There is also some initialisation code that assigns images and there are event handlers that make the buttons work but this is the main logic. If you would like to see how that stuff works, you can find it at the github repo The Evolution The following won’t include too many code snippets since it is slightly more extensive (the rushed deadline also means it resembles a tin of Heinz spaghetti in a tumble dryer but we’ll keep that between us) Lets break this down. First we have a background that was shamelessly made in powerpoint. The rules, scores, and title are all labels. The bar on the right is made up of the same button and listbox items as before but with its properties edited to change colour, font and border style. The Rules have been changed to the following: The goal is to get as close to 21 points without going over There is a Player and a Dealer Each contestant has 2 dice The player goes first Each dice spot is worth 2 points If either the player or dealer goes over 21, they lose the game After the first roll, if the player has not gone bust, they can choose to ‘stand’ or ‘hit’ If they ‘hit’, the dice are ro","date":"2019-09-24","objectID":"/inspection-and-dissection-dice-jack/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Inspection \u0026 Dissection: Dice-Jack","uri":"/inspection-and-dissection-dice-jack/"},{"categories":["Personal History","University"],"content":"We are currently in a scholarly purgatory.

I am happy with this. It’s literally the second-best results I could have achieved at this point, but there is still an unsettling feeling around me. Something is gnawing away at me that prevents me from enjoying this now. During the summer months there isn’t a clear track to follow. No daily lessons, no scheduled assignments. Any events just seem to be smeared across what could possibly be discerned to be a date on close inspection. Nothing tangible appears to be happening in terms of progress for long term goals and as such there is no certainty. The longer the time between terms, the more in flux my future appears to be. I could always fall back on the ‘everything is fine’ mantra but then it feels as if I’m not striving towards what I want, or that I’m setting myself up for future regret about not putting in the effort where it needed to be. My mind runs through permutations of events, “someone probably got 3 As, they’re the ones who are going to receive your university offer” I feel myself fretting. I shouldn’t fret, but I do. I know people who failed they’re exams and they have to repeat a year of their life, they would kill to be in my situation. There are also people who seem like demigods to me who always get perfect scores along with having elaborate and incredible side projects. To some my worries will seem preposterous, to others I will seem I don’t know how lucky I am. Perhaps I’m both these things and perhaps I’m neither. But I’m not in their situation, I’m in my situation and can only act within the context of it. I want to achieve the best possible results I can, and I didn’t. I wasn’t far off; in fact, I was damn close but it doesn’t matter the distance. Out of the 216 combinations, I have satisfied 215, and the person inside me that wanted that last one remains dissatisfied. Will 1 mark affect whether I get an offer from my preferred university? Probably not. Probably not. Probably is the most terrifying word in the English language. There are no certainties in life, everything can be prefixed with the word probably. Yet we feel the need to stick it before only a few things, I presume this is to deliberately remind us of the very large improbability of the task we about to undertake and then what is the point of even specifying a chance in the first place?

In 6 lines of code and an array of Imgur links you can have a decent and working image gallery, job sorted! Right? In truth, it unsettled me. Was this cheating? Should I have created my own gallery? This package was better than anything I could come up with and something I wasn’t prepared to spend time on but I still felt like a part of the app was no longer mine. These sorts of ideas are things I have seen keep cropping up across everything I have done. I see other people’s enemy movement packages in Unity and magic code on StackOverflow that does everything you need, but are these a step to far? Are you losing what it means to actuallly create something? I’ve had all these questions and I think I will always question myself about the balance between hard coding everything from scratch and using magic boxes that do the gruntwork for you, but for now I have decided it’s about scope. It is not within the scope of this project to make an image gallery, it is just a small feature in an app that is for doing something else. The amount of time it would take to create something like this is time that could be spent doing something else that is specific to this app and does require the time spent on it. The way I intend to go about my projects is to learn what I need out of it and the crucial elements of it. If I’m making a game in Unity I would feel uncomfortable using someone else’s movement package, movement is such a core aspect of a game’s feel that I think I should have control over its nuance. Equally, I am ok with using an image viewer package as it means I can spend more time on bigger features and I will write my own image viewer if this one is no longer fit for purpose. This is a pet project and so it is really only my own motivation that is going to get it finished. The more time I spend on a time consuming feature, the less likely it is that the project will get finished. What I want out of this app is to come out the other side of it with something that is complete and to achieve this I need to pick and choose my battles.

You can find further detail here but I’ll summarise it now. Firstly you will need to download and install Node.js This is quite self explanatory as it has an actual wizard thus not requiring any command line interaction. Node is necessary for almost anything running local javascript. Next you’ll need to open the command line (found on windows by typing ‘cmd’ into the start menu) and run this command: npm install expo-cli --global You will then be asked to create an Expo account. Next you want no navigate to the directory where you want to store your app, this is done in windows by typing ‘cd’ followed by the directory. For example : cd C:\\Users\\\u003cYour Username\u003e\\Documents\\app Then run the commands: expo init my-new-project cd my-new-project expo start ‘expo start’ will be the command you run in the directory whenever you want to run your Expo app. I would also recommend starting with the ‘tabs’ template as it places some very useful files and means you don’t need to set up your own navigation bars. After you have ran the start command your browser will open up with a QR code. Scan the QR code in the Expo app (Google Play and iOS) and behold your first expo app. If you have experience in ReactJS, you can dive into the files with your text editor of choice (I prefer VS Code) and follow the instructions both in the app and consulting the documentation. If you don’t have experience, I would recommend using the Codeacademy course on ReactJS and Javascript. Also remember Google is your best friend, if you don’t know something don’t be afraid to google it.

The classic conversation \u003eeveryone who wants to get into development goes something like this: New Guy: “What programming language is best.” Pro: “There isn’t one.” New Guy: “Ok. Well what programming language should I use for X.” Pro: “It depends.” New Guy: “Fine. Well what should I use if I want to use X for Y.” Pro: “Whatever you are comfortable with.” New Guy: “What do you mean comfortable. I’ve never programmed before, anyway its not as if a language is some sort of sofa. Hey! Where are you going! you can’t just leave me here!” Google: “Hello.” New Guy: “What.” Google: “I’m your new best friend.” There are so many use cases and things you might want to develop that almost every instance of someone’s development is bespoke to what they want. This is something that you have to have experiences before you understand it which makes it more useful for a new developer to learn while doing rather than learning then doing. I had to find the right tools for what I wanted. My requirements for this app were based off of the time constraints I had, the lack of experience I had and the needs I felt the app had: Needed to be easy to port to different platforms. Had to be easy to integrate design and programming elements together. Needed to be able to make a professional and modern look. 4.Didn’t require low level access I settled on React Native with the Expo toolchain. I felt React was by far the best option I had. The only other options were using C# to make a Xamarin.Forms app which felt a bit like using a jackhammer to do teeth surgery or learning to use Java and Objective-C/Swift to do native development and use a completely different codebase, not only would I have to learn two languages and systems at once but also would need to fork out an initial cost of $99 for an apple developer account and develop on an Mac which I neither have nor want. I’m using Expo because it means the app will be fully cross platform and I don’t need to interact with any of the awkward SDK’s and system specific stuff. Expo also provides a neat app that you run on your Android or iOS which connects to a local server with the app files and allows you to run your app within their app, no compiling, no apple developer account, no Mac. This made testing incredibly easy. Expo also handles keystoring for Android and all that fancy stuff.

You reach a dead end. Then use what you learned in that path to give you an idea of where you could go next. I’ve been trying to find a new small project for a while now. I lacked the enthusiasm to spend time making games as I generally find it is something you need to take a running jump at with a fresh idea and be able to maintain that flair through the tidal wave of texture drawing, physics calculations and gameplay design.

You reach a dead end. Then use what you learned in that path to give you an idea of where you could go next. I’ve been trying to find a new small project for a while now. I lacked the enthusiasm to spend time making games as I generally find it is something you need to take a running jump at with a fresh idea and be able to maintain that flair through the tidal wave of texture drawing, physics calculations and gameplay design.

Those 7 months were possibly the best way to get a strong foundation of how programming languages work and the general structure in which they follow. The lessons consisted of us being taught a feature (how to do ‘if’ statements, how to call functions, how to cycle through array, etc) and then being given a series of tasks that we had to create a program to complete. The first and simplest of these tasks was Bob’s Change: \"\"\"Problem: Bob would like to buy some sweets, which cost 50p. Bob has some money but, unfortunately, Bob is only 3 and has no concept of money yet. Bob’s solution to this is to just hand over the whole of his change and hope the shopkeeper will sort it out for him. The function bobs_change takes in a number representing how much money Bob has handed over (in pence). It should print the amount of change owed if he has enough, or “Sorry Bob, you don’t have enough” if he is short.\"\"\" The program would then consist of if statements returning an answer after comparing the money Bob has to the price of a product. For those starting out programming, tests of these kind are a rewarding and fun way of practicing and reinforcing skills that you have learned. When learning a programming language I would strongly suggest using these sorts of tests after learning something new to ensure you both remember that skill better and to also give you a sense of progression as a new programming language can be hard to remember if it goes unused. The rest of the tasks we went through in that course can be downloaded here. And an entire assortment of more advanced tasks in many different languages can be found at codewars.com. Really learning a skill and then practicing it is all you need to further your knowledge of programming. Once you have a grasp of basic features, you can then start to make more advanced programs using numerous packages and modules that give you the tools to create graphics and deeper features. This was how I learned to program. It broke the stages up so I wasn’t daunted by the fact I only knew what for loops were and there was so much more in the language, I only focused on the task and I found with every task I got closer to an understanding where I could begin to realise what could be done and put me on good footing for future projects.

Because I wouldn’t have made a game otherwise. You need to affirm any skills in the most basic of games. Even if it kills you making a game so boring, at least you’ve made a game and proved that you can do it. It is an important lesson to learn that you will lose interest in a project and you will have to force yourself to carry on through the mid-development slog. To get around this you have to break a project into stages and set small goals. For instance, while making pong you may set yourself the goal of making a paddle that moves with keyboard inputs and can collide with things, next you might set the goal of making a ball that can bounce off of walls, next a working scoring system and so on. Another important thing to remember is you are almost definitely doing this as a hobby so don’t spend hours forcing yourself to do something you don’t want to do. Sometimes you do have to face it but it is almost always better leaving it and waiting until the next day to finish it when you have a clear head and can be bothered to continue. Burnout can often strike. Where did you start? First I only had the idea of making a game in unity, that’s it, so I watched a series by the excellent YouTube channel Brackeys that put me on the first step to knowing what I would have to do to make a game. I then decided on pong due to the reasons answered in the previous question. If I got stuck, I consulted the Incredible Unity Documentation, Google or follow a guide by Awesome Inc. Whilst the guide was necessary for some parts, specifically the ball bouncing, I made sure I did as much as I could with only the Unity documentation and Google searches as I often found on previous years of false starts I would just copy code and not learn anything whereas figuring out these things yourself means you are much more engaged and likely to remember it. How do you think the game turned out? As my first serious game, I am pleased. The game could be made more fun with more sporadic ball movements and a single player A.I. The paddle also glitches out slightly if you keep hitting into walls but it was meant to be nothing more than proving to myself that I can make a game in Unity. It has taught me the necessary skills and I have learned from the experience enough to move onto a slightly bigger project (not much bigger). Game development is a game in itself, you start off with a tutorial then make your way up increasingly difficult stages, you wouldn’t jump into a level 50 area when your only level 5 and you wouldn’t go straight to the glowing sea in fallout 4 when all you’ve got is a is vault jumpsuit and a baseball bat.

I spent many an hour running my little orange friend across precarious ledges and away from Raiders of the Lost Ark levels of boulderage. As is usually the case with videogames during your early childhood, I imagine I didn’t get anywhere near as far as I think. I will never know though as not long into my tenure in videogames I suffered my first casualty. My PS1 and all its saves froze in a pixellated mess on my screen and in the words of John Cleese, “ceased to be”. As I played more advanced and thought-provoking games I wondered what it would take to make my own and after numerous false starts I finally made my first game (sort of). The game , Fallen Stars, was made using [Construct 2] (https://www.scirra.com/). Construct is the piece of software that makes making games so easy you can create your first game within a day, rather than programming scripts and dealing with forces you utilise an incredibly powerful ‘drag and drop’ interface with the ability to create some pretty professional looking software. I recommend watching 3kliksphilip’s Game Making Journey for an almost videogame origin story as well an explanation of what these types of tools can do. I would thoroughly recommend those who don’t know where to begin to give these prototyping software ago as it is by far the way to get the quickest turnaround of a videogame from concept to executable. Following my escapades in construct my game making took back seat as I switched to learning more programming languages past the rudimentary python skills gained at age 14 in school and final exams loomed in summer 2018. I furthered my knowledge of python and used websites such as Codeacademy to pickup the basics of JavaScript and C#; this is very useful in showing you what all different types of languages there are and the uses of them. I would like to stress at this moment I only have a basic knowledge of these thee languages. Instantiation is as advanced as it gets at the moment, just wanted to reassure anyone wanting to learn to program that you don’t need to be an expert at all these to get a grasp of what programming is like or in order to get a good base for game development. Fast-forward to now, summer 2018, and I have time for game development again and I wanted it to more closely link to my programming and software work. I chose Unity as my editor of choice for three reasons. It allows me to use the C# skills I had already put the effort in learning. It seems a lot more accessible than other engines as the structure seems more straightforward and you can get almost all features for free. It is versatile. You can make both 2D and 3D games for pretty much all platforms. It is with Unity that I went on to make my next game Ping.

The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.” -Douglas Adams I always had a desire to look under the hood of the video games and software I spent so much time on growing up but I was greeted with a rainbow of semi-colons and syntax before immediately closing the lid of my laptop and retiring back to being merely an end-user. It took until a computer science course at age 14 in my school before I was finally able to understand just the basics of what I could do with a keyboard. The language was python and the atmosphere wasn’t me alone in a bedroom at a monitor scratching my head in fury, it was a class effort. None of us understood what was going on and it made it all the more accessible. In my current exploration of programming languages I see far too many people telling those learning to code of how you ‘must’ do this and I watch videos of monotonous commentators who half explain some concepts that fly over newcomers heads. I feel the steep learning curve that programming has is a mighty feat without an actual teacher or a series of quality YouTube videos that only come around once in a blue moon. This blog will be a documentation of my journey from having basic grasps of a few programming languages through a higher education computer science course and my video-game creating antics on the side. It will detail my learning experiences and may help anyone else wanting to learn what the pathway is like.
